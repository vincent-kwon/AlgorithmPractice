# docker based operating system with
 - Features
   . Context switching and CPU scheduling
     - LRU scheduling, RoundRobin scheduling provided 
     - Each application has one folder to save icon for this application 
   . Has system daemon
     - some system daemons are launched which VinceOS is turned on
       . Some of daemons provide client level APIs to communicate with 
       . Names are SysDaemon1, SysDaemon2
   . Each process request memory to VinceKernel
     - Physical 1G memory
     - Each has 4G virtual memory
     - Shared memory only allowed for VinceOS processes
   . Each process request Window to show apps to display window
     - VinceKernel needs to manage Window stack and home button key will go
       launcher app always
     - If visible, then when cpu scheduled, running its app continuously.
     - When window is closed, no more handle needed
     - VinceKernel needs to manage concurrency issue with Semaphore
   . HW interrupt handler for fake pointing device
     - This USB based HW device is responsible to "StrangeHWEvent" so apps can 
       received signal and this event is delivered (x, y number within 1280x7200)
     - If App is not visible, this event should be delivered or not (option)
   . Filesystem (virtual file system) (B-tree based)
     - 
   . VinceOS has privilege system to control certain feature (TODO)
     -   
 - Build
   . CMake / Ninja to build
   . Need automated system to test 
   . Need binary drop whenever new git update happens
