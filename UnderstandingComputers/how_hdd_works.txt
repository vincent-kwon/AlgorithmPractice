All atoms are 
- positively charged particles called "protons" at the center
- cloud of negatively charged called "electrons" surround "necleus" (proton and neutron with no electrical charge)

In some atoms, such as copper and aluminum, the attraction is weak between proton and electrons so electrons 
jump freely from one atom to another and this move is electricity.

Nonconductive means not moving well such as rubber are insulators.

Semiconductors are on/off by condition

When electricity is moving through a wire, it creates an electromagnetic fields that surround the wire.

Electromagnetism is a form of energy that spreads in the form of waves. Light, radio, microwases, tv signals are example
of electromagnetism.

an object near electromagnetic fields are influenced by the presence, proximity, shape, composition moving through the fields

Electromagnetic radiation spectrum beginning of longest radio waves, to extreme short of gamma rays : low further, 

when coil induces a magnetic field in the core, move iron particles in the disk positive, positive, negative aligned and
it is called one band and two bands represents 1 bit. If particles in both bands are aligned in the same direction 0.
if different 1.
