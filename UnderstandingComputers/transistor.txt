transistor is basic building block from which all microchips are built.
It only creates binary information: 1 if current passes through, 0 if current doesn't pass through
Combination of transitors can create logic gate (full adder) 

If positive electrical is sent down one aluminum lead that runs into transitor,
it flows to "polysilicon" and it attracts negative electrons and it bridge source and drain 
by rushed negative electrons and it completes circuit and it represents 1.

If negative charge is applied, the transitor turns off.

Then how "postive" charge can flow to a silicon?
