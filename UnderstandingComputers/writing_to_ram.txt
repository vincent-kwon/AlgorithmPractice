A software sends a burst of electricity along an address line.

Each addressline (if 16bit, 65532 address selectable) identifies location of a spot of a chip
where data can be stored.

Address line is like pipe and data only goes to the where address line is connected (like pipe)

And it charges "capacitor" to 1 so "closed" transitor and "charge or no charge" to capacitor

Reading data is same. Closed transitor for address line, get data from data line for each capacitor 
of the address.
