Flash is different from RAM. 

Control gate and floating gate charges are compared by bit sense and if more than half control is called "open" and cell represent 1.

If below half, it is 0. 

There is bit line and word line: control gate is connected with word line to determine word address.

To change the value of cell to zero, tunneling is used. In tunneling, a current from bit line travels through floating gate transistor,
exiting through "ground" then electrons boil off the floating gate and trapped in control gate (1) 

Energy from current causes electrons to boil off the floating gate and ????  

And most of all, all the trapped electrons keep even no electricity applied.
