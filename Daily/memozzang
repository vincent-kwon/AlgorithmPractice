semaphore:
semaphore to shared memory, multiprocess, -2 to request alloc, +2 return after use, if -2 is waiting and something to +3, then automatically executed, sem_t sem_get sem_ctrl sem_post sem_wait sem_destroy, mmap(NULL?, size, protection, visibility, 0?, 0?), munmap(pointer, size),

c++exception:
const char*, const noexcept, *this, stdexcept, exception what(), runtime_error, invalid_argument, bad_alloc, overflow_error, underflow_error

Arduino:
1. void setup(); void loop(); Serial.println(val); Serial.begin(9600), 
2. LED Connect: long-13, short-ohm-ground, pinMode(14, OUTPUT), digitalWrite(13, HIGH) // 5V, digitalWrite(13, low) // 0v, delay(millisecond),
3. LED bright-dark: analogWrite(13, 0 ~ 255) // 255 max, analogWrite send current via PWM
4. How to adjust signal width
       _           _
     PWM: _| |_________| |__ (250 Hz) : 1 sec, 250 times (per 1/250 sec)
  
          |-----------| (from up to next up) takes 4ms (1/250)

            _     _
          _| |___| |___ (500 Hz) : 1 sec, 500 times (per 1/500 sec) 

5. DUTY Rate: another way of adjust signal, how much HIGH kept of total: 1 means all high
6. In arduinio, interrupts (for example timer interrupts ever 1/1000 sec) call functions by HW event.
7. Timer: #include<TimerOne.h>, Timer1.initialize(100000); // timer interval to 1/10 sec, Timer1.attachInterrupt(timerIsr);
8. interrupt: noInterrupts(); interrupts();
9. when to connect to ground? when to connect to 5v? when to Ohm? For LED, long to VCC/5v, short to GND/0v, LED needs wit ohm directly
   Bigger ohm, currenct from 5V to GND diminish and LED will be darker
10. Bread pan: long to ohm to 5V, short to GND
11. LED needs lowest ohm
